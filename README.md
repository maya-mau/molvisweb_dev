# MolVisWeb (dev)

This is the dev repository for MolVisWeb, my senior thesis project. Changes are made here before being copied over to the [main repository](https://github.com/maya-mau/molvisweb). 

## Description

MolVisWeb is a web-based molecular visualization interface that can be used to carry out the [EMMAs](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00036), or Exploring Molecular Modeling Activities. The EMMAs are a series of educational activities designed by *Kotsalidis et al.* to teach high school chemistry students about noncovalent bonding through case studies and exploratory exercises using the 3D molecular visualization tool VMD. VMD, or Visual Molecular Dynamics, is a robust molecular visualization software used for both research and education. MolVisWeb is loosely based on VMD and has all the functionality necessary to complete the EMMAs, but with a simpler, more user-friendly interface geared towards education. Users can choose to view a molecule/complex from a dropdown menu of available PDB files. From there, they can change the drawing/coloring method, add multiple representations to visualize different parts of the molecule/complex, and manipulate the molecule/complex. 

An [updated version of the EMMAs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TyMhYdRIeawEn1XgHaA3DwX0qAkapj59?usp=drive_link) was adapted from the original EMMAs by *Kotsalidis et al.* to go along with MolVisWeb. Currently, activities 1-6 are fully functional. Alternatively, activities 2 & 4 /(the activities that involve using a molecular visualization software) can be found on the right panel of MolVisWeb.
